# AI Transparency Dashboard - Botspeak Framework

This project is an interactive educational website that teaches the concept of Data Visualization for AI Transparency, a key pillar in the Botspeak framework. The site serves as an educational resource demonstrating how proper visualization techniques can make AI systems more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy.

## Live Demo

Visit the site: [AI Transparency Dashboard](https://assignment-1-psi-rouge.vercel.app/)

## Project Overview

This educational website fulfills the "Teach a Botspeak Concept" assignment by providing comprehensive coverage of AI transparency visualization principles. The project includes:

### 1. Concept Exploration
- Clear definition of Data Visualization for AI Transparency
- Connections to philosophical foundations (Hume, Popper, McLuhan)
- Integration with the Botspeak framework

### 2. Purpose & Significance
- Impact on AI system reliability, safety, and usefulness
- Benefits for stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds
- Role in responsible AI development

### 3. Real-World Applications
- Success case: Medical AI Decision Support
- Cautionary tale: Content Moderation Without Transparency

### 4. Educational Scenario
- Detailed loan risk assessment AI scenario
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Dashboard acceptance testing criteria

### 5. Interactive Elements
- Visual demonstrations of key visualization types:
  - Calibration plots (reliability diagrams)
  - Fairness metrics across demographic groups
  - Feature importance visualizations
  - Drift monitoring dashboards
  - Confusion matrices

### 6. Assessment Tools
- Knowledge check quiz with automated scoring
- Practical dashboard critique exercise with feedback

## Technical Implementation

The website was created using:
- HTML5 for structure
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- SVG for interactive visualizations
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

The site is designed to be:
- Responsive across different devices
- Accessible following web standards
- Lightweight without external dependencies

## Development Process

1. **Concept Selection**: Chose Data Visualization for AI Transparency from the Nine Pillars of AI Fluency
2. **Content Development**: Created comprehensive educational material based on course content
3. **Visualization Design**: Developed SVG-based visualizations to demonstrate key concepts
4. **Interactive Elements**: Added quiz functionality and critique submission capabilities
5. **Deployment**: Published the site using GitHub and Vercel

## Deployment

The project was deployed using the following steps:

1. Created a GitHub repository at [PrashanthTalwarr/Assignment-1](https://github.com/PrashanthTalwarr/Assignment-1)
2. Pushed the HTML code to the repository
3. Connected the repository to Vercel for automatic deployment
4. The site is now live at [https://assignment-1-psi-rouge.vercel.app/](https://assignment-1-psi-rouge.vercel.app/) and automatically updates when changes are pushed to GitHub

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- The Botspeak framework and its application to AI transparency
- Principles of effective data visualization for AI systems
- How visualization choices affect user perception and decision-making
- Practical implementation of transparency dashboards
- McLuhan's concept that "the medium is the message" applied to AI interfaces

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- Add more interactive visualizations with real data
- Implement a backend to save quiz results and user feedback
- Create additional educational scenarios for different AI applications
- Add animated transitions to better explain visualization concepts
